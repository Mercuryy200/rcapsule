## Live Demo

Visit the live application at [rcapsule.com](https://rcapsule.com) to see Rcapsule in action.

## Database Schema

The application uses a normalized PostgreSQL schema with the following main tables:

![Schema](public/images/supabase-schema-closet.png)

All tables implement Row Level Security (RLS) to ensure users can only access their own data.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel with automatic CI/CD:

1. Push to the main branch
2. Vercel automatically builds and deploys
3. Environment variables are configured in Vercel dashboard

## Performance

- Server-side rendering with Next.js App Router
- Optimized image loading and compression
- Lighthouse score: 95+
- Fast page loads and smooth interactions

## Testing

The project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with [MSW](https://mswjs.io/) (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking.

```
pnpm test            # run all tests
pnpm vitest --coverage  # run with coverage report
```

**72 tests** across 8 test suites — all passing.

| Suite | Tests | What's covered |
|-------|------:|----------------|
| `tests/api/signup.test.ts` | 11 | Input validation, username rules, duplicate checks, successful signup |
| `tests/api/clothes.test.ts` | 10 | CRUD operations, auth guards, ownership verification, DB errors |
| `tests/api/catalog.test.ts` | 6 | Product listing, cache hit/miss headers, pagination, search suggestions |
| `tests/api/checkout.test.ts` | 6 | Auth checks, billing cycle validation, Stripe session creation |
| `tests/services/ai-recommendations.test.ts` | 10 | Recommendation structure, wardrobe item matching, multi-provider support (OpenAI/Anthropic), error recovery |
| `tests/services/weather.test.ts` | 10 | Weather context, temp rounding, cold/hot flags, rain/umbrella/layer detection, API fallback |
| `tests/lib/redis.test.ts` | 10 | Cache get/set/delete, TTL defaults, multi-key delete, error resilience |
| `tests/lib/ratelimit.test.ts` | 9 | User/IP identifier extraction, 429 responses, Retry-After headers, forwarded-for parsing |

**Coverage thresholds** (enforced in `vitest.config.ts`):

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Lines | 70% |
| Functions | 70% |
| Statements | 70% |
| Branches | 60% |

**Test infrastructure:**
- **MSW** intercepts HTTP calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, and OpenWeather APIs
- **Vitest `vi.mock`** stubs Supabase, Stripe, Redis, and NextAuth at the module level
- **Global setup** (`tests/setup.ts`) starts/stops the MSW server and resets handlers between tests

## Error Monitoring & Performance

- Sentry Integration: Comprehensive error tracking with user context
- Performance Monitoring: Database query optimization and API response tracking
- Breadcrumbs: User action tracking for better debugging
- Production-Ready: Proper error boundaries and graceful degradation
